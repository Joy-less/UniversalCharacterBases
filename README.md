# Universal Character Bases

Free, easy and likable pixel character bases.

It can be tricky to make pixel art characters without experience. While there are plenty of free pixel character sprites on the internet, they generally have complex shading and are hard to modify to your likings.

## Features

The Universal Character Bases are sprites I've created with the intention of being easy to use, flexible and aesthetically pleasing.

The pack contains a male and female spritesheet. Each spritesheet is 96x256 pixels (32x64 pixels per sprite) and have only two colors (except for the eyes) making them super-easy to customize. The side-view sprites partially face the screen, so designing for each angle is similar.
